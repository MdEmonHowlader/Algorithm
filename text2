1. Ibrahim is passionate about football and has dedicated much of his time to watching games. Over time,
he's discerned various patterns in the sport. For instance, he's noticed that each football team has two
sets of jerseys: one for home games and another for away games. When a team plays at their own
stadium, they wear their home jersey. However, when they play away at another team's stadium, they
wear their away jersey. There's one exception to this rule: if the home team's jersey color matches the
away team's jersey, the home team wears their away jersey instead. Additionally, each team's home and
away jerseys feature different colors to distinguish them clearly.
In the English Premier League, there are n teams participating. Throughout the league, there will be a total
of n·(n - 1) games, as each team plays against every other team once. Ibrahim is curious: how many times,
regardless of the game order, will a home team wear its away jersey during the league?
You have information about the colors of the home and away uniforms for each team, with each color
assigned a unique integer. To simplify matters, no two distinct colors share the same number. Assist
Ibrahim in determining the solution to his question.
Input
The input consists of an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 30) on the first line. Following that are n lines, each
containing a pair of distinct space-separated integers hi and ai (where 1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100). These integers
represent the colors of the home and away jerseys, respectively, for the i-th team.
Output
In a single line print the number of matches where the host team is going to play in the away jersey.

2. Mozid Introduced an interesting game to his classmates of 63_Q. He said to his classmates- A
participant who achieves a score equal to or higher than the score of the contestant in the k-th position
will progress to the next round, provided they attain a positive score themselves.
There were n participants in the contest (where n ≥ k), and their scores are known.
Determine the number of participants who will proceed to the next round.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the score earned
by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for
all i from 1 to n - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai ≥ ai + 1).
Output
Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

3. Shahriar and Marjan are gearing up for programming contests.
Marjan, who enjoys debugging, has to compile her code before running and debugging
it. Initially, the compiler detected n compilation errors, each represented by a positive
integer. After some effort, Marjan managed to fix two mistakes.
However, Marjan is uncertain about the specific errors she corrected because the
compiler displays errors in a different order each time. Marjan is confident that unlike
many other programming languages, the compilation errors in his language are
independent of each other. This means that fixing one error doesn't affect the set of
other errors.
Can you help Marjan determine the exact two errors he corrected?
Input
The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105
) — the initial number of compilation
errors.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109
) — the errors the
compiler displayed for the first time.
The third line contains n - 1 space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn - 1 — the errors displayed at the
second compilation. It is guaranteed that the sequence in the third line contains all numbers of
the second string except for exactly one.
The fourth line contains n - 2 space-separated integers с1, с2, ..., сn - 2 — the errors displayed at the
third compilation. It is guaranteed that the sequence in the fourth line contains all numbers of
the third line except for exactly one.
Output
Print two numbers on a single line: the numbers of the compilation errors that disappeared
after B made the first and the second correction, respectively.

4. Omim has got three quiz marks. quiz 1, quiz 2 and quiz 3. He keeps these numbers in secret,
but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three
numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in
random order: quiz1+quiz2, quiz2+quiz3, quiz1+quiz3 and quiz1+quiz2+quiz3
You have to guess three numbers quiz1, quiz2 and quiz3 using given numbers. Print three
guessed integers in any order.
Pay attention that some given numbers quiz1, quiz2 and quiz3 can be equal (it is also possible
that quiz1=quiz2=quiz3).
Input
The only line of the input contains four positive integers x1,x2,x3,x4 (2≤xi≤10^9) — numbers written
on a board in random order. It is guaranteed that the answer exists for the given number x1,x2,x3,x4
Output
Print such positive integers quiz1, quiz2, quiz3 that four numbers written on a board are
values quiz1+quiz2, quiz2+quiz3, quiz1+quiz3 and quiz1+quiz2+quiz3
written in some order. Print quiz1, quiz2, quiz3 in any order. If there are several answers, you can
print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
