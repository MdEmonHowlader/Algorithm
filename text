---Hridoy lives in a very different world from ours where 
number of symbols available in that world is not 
specified. While using a new application, he needs to set 
password to create an account. he needs to first give an 
input n. n denotes 2 things: the total number of symbol 
in that world at the same n is also the number of 
symbols the application takes to set input and each 
symbol can be used only once to set password. Now 
write a program where hridoy gives input n and the 
output shows the number of ways he can set his 
password with that.
Input:
N = 5
Output:
120
Input:
N = 7
Output:
5040
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 18

---In Daffodil International School a new math teacher 
introduces a new series and he named the series 
multinacci series. Where 1st number is 1, 2nd number is 2 
and from then next number is the multiplication of the 2 
previous numbers. For example 3rd number is 1X2=2, 4th
number is 2X2=4 and so on. Write a code where first a 
input n will be taken and output shows the n-th value in 
that series.
Input:
N = 5
Output:
8
Input:
N = 7
Output:
256
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 20
